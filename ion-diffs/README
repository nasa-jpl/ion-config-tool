These scripts support analysis of changes between ion releases, specifically ion config file changes. 
The changes can be quite complex, so the release notes are usually insufficient.  The detailed docs are better.
The focus of the analysis in on individual pod files (a perl-related document format) per each config file type.
The output are simple diff command outputs per file, so the developer must perform a visual inspection to identify
relevant changes to ion command syntax.

The diff scripts assume that each new ion distribution is unzipped into a directory with its version number.
For example:  ion-4.0.0, ion-4.1.0

The script intrnally defines the root directory for versions of ion, so this should be updated as needed.
The script takes the two version numbers as arguments, older version first.
The single output file appears locally with both version numbers, such as: 4.0.0-vs-4.1.0.diffs 
There were significant structure changes with the ION V4 series, so there are two versions of the scripts:

  mkdiffsv3.sh
  mkdiffsv4.sh

If new config file types are integrated into the ionconfig tool, the script must be updated.

Example execution:
> mkdiffsv4.sh  4.0.0   4.1.0

A few sample analysis files appear here.  These were prepared by hand after reviewing the diff report.
