The ionVersions.json is a json object listing and describing each ION version supported
by the ionconfig tools.  Importantly, this file maps ION version numbers to the simple
ionconfig sequence numbers. The simple numners support the ionconfig command effectivity
scheme.

Sample entries follow:

{
  "13" : {
     "seqNum": 13,
     "ionVersion": "4.1.0",
     "desc": "ION 4.1.0 release",
     "released": "2021-05-31"
   },
  "12" : {
     "seqNum": 12,
     "ionVersion": "4.0.2",
     "desc": "ION 4.0.2 release",
     "released": "2021-02-26"
   },
...

The name of each sub-object corresponds to the version sequence number, e.g., "12".

Properties:

seqNum        repeats the name of the sub-object as a simple numeric value

ionVersion    provides the standard multi-part ION version identifier

desc          provides a basic text description of the release

released      provides the official date of the ION release at sourceforge
