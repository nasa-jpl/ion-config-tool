The cmdTypes.json is a json object listing and describing each ION command type
supported by the ionconfig tools.  In some cases, there are multiple command types
as viewed by ionconfig tools versus a single command type as viewed by ION. This makes 
it possible for the tool to be more precise about the specific command parameters.
There can also be new versions of a command due to some eveolution within the ION
software,

Sample entries follow:

{
  "acsrc_custodian": {
    "configType": "acsrc",
    "name": "custodian",
    "order": 30,
    "paramCnt": 3,
    "paramTypes": [],
    "pickClone": true,
    "verFrom": 10,
    "verThru": 999
  },
...
  "bpv6rc_induct_ltp": {
    "configType": "bpv6rc",
    "copyClone": true,
    "isCloned": true,
    "name": "induct_ltp",
    "order": 54,
    "paramCnt": 2,
    "paramTypes": [],
    "verFrom": 10,
    "verThru": 999
  },
...
  "bpv6rc_run_ipnadmin": {
    "configType": "bpv6rc",
    "copyClone": true,
    "name": "run_ipnadmin",
    "order": 90,
    "paramCnt": 1,
    "paramTypes": [],
    "verFrom": 10,
    "verThru": 999
  },

The name of each sub-object corresponds to the command type, e.g., "bpv6rc_induct_ltp".
Note that config file type is always included in the name. When a new version of a
command arises due to ION changes, a version is added to the name, e.g., "ipnrc_cosovrd_v12".

Properties:

configType    names the ion config file type using this command type

multiple      true indicates that mulitple instances of this command are
              possible for one config file.  Can be omitted if false.

name          the common name of the command as used in ion documents

order         an integer used to arrange the order of commands within the file

paramCnt      the count of parameters supported by this command

paramTypes    a list for each unique parameter in paramTypes.json for this 
              command type (this is populated later when all the json files are loaded)

pickClone     true indicates there is at least one parameter that must be selected from
              a list of "clone" values.  Clone values are created by other ion commands
              such as ipn numbers, port numbers, etc.  These are called clone values,
              because these will change automatically if the original command declaring 
              the value is changed.  

copyClone     true indicates that at least one parameter will be automatically assigned
              a "clone" value. This happens when another command establishes the value.

isCloned      true indicates that a clone value is created when this command is declared.
              A clone value is usually based on one paramete, but can be based on more
              than one parameter, such as some induct names (e.g., host12:1113)

verFrom       The first version for which this command type applies.  The tools can handle
              ion nodes with different versions of ION at the same time.  The ionconfig
              system uses simple integers as proxies for ION versions in order to simplify
              the identification of commands effective for a specific version.
              By convention, the first numeric version is 10.

verThru       The last version for which this command type applies.  By convention, the
              highest possible numeric version is 999.  This is the default verThru value
              until a command becomes obsoleted at a specific ION version.
