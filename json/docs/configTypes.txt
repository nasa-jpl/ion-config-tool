The configTypes.json is a json object listing and describing each ION configuration
file type supported by the ionconfig tools.  Some ION config file types remain out of
scope.  

Sample entries follow:

{
    "ionconfig" : {
        "id": "ionconfig",
        "content": "ION node configuration parameters file",
        "program": "ionadmin",
        "start_order": 0,
        "cmdTypes": [ ]
    },
    "ionrc" : {
        "id": "ionrc",
        "content": "ION node management commands file",
        "program": "ionadmin",
        "start_order": 10,
        "cmdTypes": [ ]
    },
...

The name of each sub-object corresponds to the file type, e.g., "ionrc".

Properties:

id            repeats the name of the sub-object

content       provides a text description of the file type

program       identifies the ION program that reads the configuration file

start_order   indicates the order in which to start a program per config file

cmdTypes      a list for each unique command in cmdTypes.json for this config type
              (this is populated later when all the json files are loaded)
