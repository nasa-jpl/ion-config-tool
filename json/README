These parameter json files were first developed for the ionconfig browser tool in order to
insulate the source code from routine changes to ION commands.  The ION system continues
to evolve version by version, usually with relevant changes to the configuration files
and the ION commands supported within each configuration file type.  These json files
help capture this variations in declarative form, a form better suited for static analysis
and verification.
