   RELEASE PROCEDURE

Upon finishing the build process, one can create a release for end users. The latest
release.json should already exist from the build process. See RELEASE for the
description of release.json. Now summarize the release updates in the release.notes
text file.

The release product is a versioned tar ball of end user software and documentation.
Running the release script will deposit the new tar ball in the ./tars subdirectory,
like so:

> ./dorelease.sh
