   RELEASE PROCEDURE

Upon finishing the build process, one can create a release for end users. The latest
release.json should already exist from the build process. See RELEASE for the
description of release.json. Now summarize the release updates in the release.notes
text file.

Open the sample ION model called rel.ion3node.json found in the /script sub-directory
and make sure it loads without error. Fix any errors by editing the ION model in the
GUI and save it to rel.ion3node.json and commit to github.

The release product is a versioned tar ball of end user software and documentation.
Running the release script will deposit the new tar ball in the ./tars subdirectory,
like so:

> ./dorelease.sh
