   RELEASE JSON OBJECT

The build/release process depends on the release.json object defined at the root 
directory.  It defines the applicable ION version and the release version of the
IonConfig tools.  It includes a simple integer seqNum used internally by IonConfig
tools to distinguish supported command types among the ION versions.

Example:

"release" : {
   "seqNum": 13,
   "ionVersion": "4.1.0",
   "ionConfigVersion": "4.6.1",
   "desc": "IonConfig Tools Release 4.6.1"
}

ionConfigVersion: the release version of the IonConfig tools.  There will normally
  be at least one release of the tools per release of ION, though there can be more
  for bug fixes or new features.  A dictionary is built per IonConfig tool release, 
  since the dictionary could also have bug fixes unrelated to changes to ION.

ionVersion: the release version of ION via Git Hub (https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN).

seqNum: The IonConfig tools use a simple integer to correspond to the ION version.
  This makes it easier to map a specific command type to ION versions.  The IonConfig
  tools can support a network with nodes having differing ION versions, keeping track
  of which command types are supported by which ION version.  This internal command 
  mapping by seqNum also enables the version command delta analysis.
