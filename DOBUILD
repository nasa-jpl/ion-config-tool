   BUILD PROCEDURE

The build procedure is a combination of manual and automated procedures. Some steps
require analysis, verification or documentation.  Other steps have supporting scripts
that largely automate the process.

Upon finishing the build process, one can create a release for end users.  See the 
description in DORELEASE.


1) Analyze the changes in the latest ION release.

   A new ION release is one the main drivers for a new release of the IonConfig tools.
   Each new release of ION usually has some config file or command changes, sometimes
   significant changes. It is important to identify and analyze these changes.

   The analysis method is found in ./ion-diffs, relying on diffs of ion docs.
   Further explanation is found in ./ion-diffs/README.

2) Update the json configuration files.

   Routine ion command changes can often be handled by appropriate updates to
   the json configuration files.  This helps restrain the growth of the source
   code.

   The latest version of the json configuration files in found in ./json.
   Further description of the configuration files is at ./json/README and ./json/docs/*.

3) Build the dictionary docs.

   These docs are intended for the end user.  The full dictionary defines the full
   suite of ION config files and ION commands supported by IonConfig.  The delta
   dictionary highlights the changes from the prior ION release.

   The dictionary build will also expose errors in the construction of the json files,
   so it is helpful to build the dictionaries early in the process. For this reason,
   the procedure is semi-manual so that errors can be found and fixed.

   Note that the dictionaries are re-built for every release of the IonConfig tools,
   not just for new versions of ION.  This covers the case where the json files are
   changing due to a bug fix rather than a direct change to ION. 

   For more information see ./dict/README, ./dict/PROCEDURE, ./dict/LISTING and
   ./dict/docs/README.

4) Update and re-build the IonConfig Editor (the web browser tool).

   TBD

5) Update the IonConfig Editor Manual.

   The IonConfig Editor manual is an html document with supporting png files. 
   The basic functions do not change much, so the manual does not change often.

   The manual files are found in ./manual.

   For more information, see ./manual/README.

6) Update and re-build the IonConfig command-line tools.

   The source code is in ./cli/src.  The final executables are put to ./cli/bin.

   The executables are built with the script ./cli/make.sh.

   For more information, see ./cli/README and ./cli/docs/README.
