These files comprise a users' manual for the browser-based IonConfig tool.

To view the manual, use a standard web browser to load the file "user-manual.html".

The user-manual.html references each of the png files which provide annotated screen shots
of the IonConfig web browser tool.  The annotated png files were created with the "skitch"
application.
