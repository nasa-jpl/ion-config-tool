Developers notes after installing node.js and cloning repo

To begin running, modifying and debugging the ION config
tool, in the editor directory run these commands:

     > npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
     > npm install

This should bring in all the dependencies that the ION
config tool needs to run. To test the checkout of ION
config tool run this command:

     > npm start

This should start the ION config tool editor in your
default web browser. Starting this way will also make
the developer tools in the browser aware of the source
code. Thus, break points, watches, console output, etc... 
are available while developing and debugging. It will also
enable hot reloading when changes to the source are made.

For building and deploying the ION config tool for 
distribution see DOBUILD and DORELEASE in the ionconfig
directory.

NOTE: I, Dave Hanks, always used the Chrome browser for
development and testing. If you do not use Chrome your
mileage may vary. Happy coding!
