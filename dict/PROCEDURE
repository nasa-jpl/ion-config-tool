   Dictionary build procedure

The build procedure is semi-manual so that any errors in the json
configuration files can be discovered and corrected. Each new release
will usually have some updates to the json configurations and it is 
easy for small errors to creep in.  These dictionary scripts will report
any errors encountered.

1) Initialize the build process.
   Creates release-specific json dir, and clears work dirs.

   > ./init.py

2) Pull the official json config files to local directory.

   > ./pull.sh

3) [Optional] Verify the json files.

   > ./checkjson.py

4) Build the full version-specific command dictionary.

   > ./makeDict.sh

5) Build the changes-only delta command dictionary.

   > ./makeDelta.sh

The final html documents are saved in the docs subdirectory.
