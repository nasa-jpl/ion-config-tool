The two command dictionary documents are delivered as html documents.

   dict.html  - full current dictionary of ion commands
   delta.html - ion command changes from prior version

The 'dict.html' is the main dictionary doc, describing all of the ION configuration
files and commands supported by the current release.  The dictionary is generated 
from the JSON files used by the IonConfig tools. These JSON files declaratively 
specify the ION config file types, commands, parameters and versions.  

The 'delta.html' is a supplementary dictionary doc, providing a delta report with
respect to the immediately preceding ION version. It describes each new command plus 
each obsolete command replaced or dropped in the current release.

View each html doc by simply loading the file into any standard web browser.
