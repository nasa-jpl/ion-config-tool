Developers notes after installing npm and cloning repo

To create and run the CLI tools do the following steps
in the cli/ directory

     > npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
     > npm install
     > ./make.sh

This should bring in all the dependencies that the ION
config tool command line interface executables need and
generate the CLI executables. To test the checkout and
generation of the CLI tools go the the cli/bin directory
and execute this command:

     > ./checkdtn.js -m <Net Model file>

To get an example Net Model file, you can generate one
yourself using the GUI version or you can ask around
for one.

If that command runs without error, try the other CLI
tools.

    > ./dtn2ion.js -m <Net Model file>
    > ./ionconfig.js -m <ION Model file>
    > ./ionsurvey.js -m <ION Model file>

Note that the ./dtn2ion.js script will generate an ION
Model file appropriate for use in the scripts that need one.

There are other command line options in some of the
CLI tools, see the top of each CLI executable for them.

For building and deploying the CLI tools for 
distribution see DOBUILD and DORELEASE in the ionconfig
directory.
