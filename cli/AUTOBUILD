The CLI tools use many functions found in the GUI code with 
some modifications. These modifications are necessary because
of the dependency of the GUI code on React. 

Those source files contain special markers in comment blocks
to enable the successful automatic extraction and conversion
of the React based GUI code into versions that will work as 
CLI tools. Do NOT remove these special comments or the CLI
tools will be broken and unusable. When changing functions
that contain these comments, take care to be sure that if
you introduce new code that contains React based dependencies
that the CLI tools still work correctly. The way to accomplish
this is once you have finished modifying the GUI code, run
the build process on the CLI tools and verify they still
run and have the expected output.

The motivation for this is simple. Prior to the automatic 
extraction of the GUI source into acceptable CLI form the
process was manual and error prone. Also, a developer of
the code has to remember which functions in which source
files contain code that is shared so that when changes are
made the CLI code and GUI code are kept consistent.

Refer to the extractCode.py Python script in the /script
subdirectory to see which GUI source files and functions 
are automatically extracted and formatted for the CLI tools.
