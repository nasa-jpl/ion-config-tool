The cli area supports the build and testing of ionconfig command-line programs.

The programs are deposited to /bin:

   checkdtn.js  - verify syntax and content of a dtn network model
   dtn2ion.js   - generate a full ion model from a dtn network model
   ionconfig.js - generate full ion config files for all nodes from an ion model

These programs depend on their companion json and node_modules directories.
Note the json directory is shared at the root level of ionconfig.

The make.sh script builds all of the programs, simply binding together multiple
script files.

The /src subdirectory holds all of the script files used to build the complete
programs.

The /script subdirectory holds supporting scripts used by make.sh.

The /tests subdirectory provides test files and test programs for each program.
