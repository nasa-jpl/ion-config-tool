The cli area supports the build and testing of ionconfig command-line programs.

The programs are deposited to /bin:

   checkdtn.js  - verify syntax and content of a DTN network model
   dtn2ion.js   - generate a full ION model from a DTN network model
   ionconfig.js - generate full ION config files for all nodes from an ION
                  model
   ionsurvey.js - generate a survey report for an ION model

These programs depend on their companion json and node_modules directories.
Note the json directory is shared at the root level of ionconfig.

The make.sh script builds all of the programs by extracting from the ION
config GUI source files in editor/src the pertinent parts shared by the
CLI tools, and some CLI specific code in cli/src and binding together the 
relevent source files into the complete javascript programs in /bin.

See the AUTOBUILD file in cli/src for more information.

The /src subdirectory holds the CLI specific script files used to build the
programs.

The /src/auto directory holds the CLI script files that are automatically
extracted from the source files in editor/src.

The /script subdirectory holds supporting scripts used by make.sh.

The /tests subdirectory provides test files and test programs for each
program. (TBD)
